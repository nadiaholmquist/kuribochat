> **Notice:** This project was made for my own amusement for use on my own Discord server. Please only use this if you are familiar with Kotlin and the relevant APIs and can fix things yourself if they break, I will not be providing any support for using this program.

# KuriboChat

KuriboChat is a simple OpenAI ChatGPT-powered Discord bot written in Kotlin using the Kord and OpenAI API libraries.

To use it, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variables with the respective keys, and `PROMPT_FILE` to the location of a text file containing the initial prompt that will be given to the OpenAI chat request.
